Things discussed on piazza to ensure our code satisfies:

- Raccoons will always move if they can (eqaul probability for all possible moves)
- Raccoons are considered trapped while inside a GarbageCan
- For calculating score, a Raccoon in a GarbageCan is NOT considered trapped
- SmartRaccoons do not prioritize unlocked GarbageCans over locked GarbageCans
- SmartRaccoons will not move if a player is in between it and a GarbageCan
